    Special thanks to the <a href="https://www.expresslrs.org/" target="_blank" >ExpressLRS</a> dev community members
    who helped answer questions, and troubleshoot issues during the development of this application.
  axes-viewer-help: |
    Axis values used by this application are in RAW format,
    exactly as the gamepad outputs them. When an axis is centered, 
    the RAW value is `0`. The minimum, and maximum RAW axis values 
    are `-32768` and `32767` respectively.
        
      
    The application only converts these RAW values to CRSF format
    at the very end, before writing them to an ExpressLRS RF transmitter.
      
      
    The other formats are provided here so you can visualize how the RAW values
    would be interpreted by a flight controller or RF receiver with PWM output.
  buttons-viewer-help: |
    Button values used by this application in RAW format,
    exactly as the gamepad outputs them. When a button is active, 
    the RAW value is `1`, otherwise it's `0` when inactive.
      
      
    However, for convenience the **Button** nodes in the **Inputs Config** 
    page are configured to output RAW value `32767` when a 
    button is active, and `0` when it's inactive.
    (You can change these defaults in the node settings)
      
      
    The application only converts these RAW values to CRSF format
    at the very end, before writing them to the RF transmitter.

  channels-viewer-help: |
    Channel values used by ExpressLRS RF transmitters are always in CRSF format.
      
      
    The RAW format is the internal representation used by this application.
      
      
    The other formats are provided here so you can visualize how the CRSF values
    would be interpreted by a flight controller or RF receiver with PWM output.
  rf-link-dialog-title: |
    Start / Stop RF Link
  rf-link-dialog-help: |
    Use this dialog to start or stop the radio frequency link
  rf-link-tx-title: |
    Transmitter port
  rf-link-tx-help: |
    This is the serial port name for the RF transmitter device.
  rf-link-baud-rate-title: |
    Baud rate
  rf-link-baud-rate-help: |
    This is the communication speed between the application and the RF transmitter device. 
    It is measured in **Bauds**. 
      
      
    For high CRSF packet refresh rates , e.g. `F1000 Hz`, you will need to use **Baud** rate of 
    at least `400000`. Check the documentation of the chipset used in 
    your RF transmitter (or FTDI adapter) to see what baud rates are supported. 
      
      
    Alternatively, you can start with the lowest baud rate, and sequentially try higher baud 
    rates until you find the highest one that works. 
      
      
    You can use the link statistics to see if the link is working correctly. The the number of
    sent and received packets should increase steadily without significant number of errors.
  port-state-title: |
    Port state
  port-state-help: |
    This is the current state of the RF device serial port. This is only monitored while the RF link is active.
      
      
    If it's **Disconnected**, it means that the link is active, but there is no RF device connected on the given port.
      
      
    If it's **Connected**, it means that that the link is active, and there is an RF device connected on the given port.
  sent-packets-title: |
    Sent packets count
  sent-packets-help: |
    This is the total number of packets sent to the RF transmitter.
  received-packets-title: |
    Received packets count
  received-packets-help: |
    This is the total number of packets received from the RF transmitter.
  error-packets-title: |
    Error packets count
  error-packets-help: |
    This is the number of packets received from the RF transmitter that resulted in error during processing.
